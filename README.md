# Cypress Basics

In this project, I would like to share test automation activities that I have done during basic [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) platform using [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) language. Link to the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cypress-od-podstaw/). The course is an introduction to Cypress and includes some basics, such as setting up a new project, interactions on web elements, page object modelling, etc.
